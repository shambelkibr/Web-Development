## What are Semantic Elements?

HTML was originally created as a markup language to describe documents on the early internet. As the internet grew and was adopted by more people, its needs changed.

Where the internet was originally intended for sharing scientific documents, now people wanted to share other things as well. Very quickly, people started wanting to make the web look nicer.

Because the web was not initially built to be designed, programmers used different hacks to get things laid out in different ways. Rather than using the <table></table> to describe information using a table, programmers would use them to position other elements on a page.

As the use of visually designed layouts progressed, programmers started to use a generic “non-semantic” tag like <div>. They would often give these elements a class or id attribute to describe their purpose. For example, instead of <header> this was often written as <div class="header">.

As HTML5 is still relatively new, this use of non-semantic elements is still very common on websites today.

List of new semantic elements
The semantic elements added in HTML5 are:

<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
